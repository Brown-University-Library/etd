  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Ph.D. candidates at Brown must file their dissertations electronically. Brown's electronic theses and dissertation (ETD) system was developed by the Graduate School and the University Library and launched in 2008. The system is designed to collect and archive the final dissertation as a text-based PDF file.</p>

  <p>To complete the submission process doctoral candidates must have successfully defended their dissertation and had it approved by their committee. To use the ETD system, doctoral candidates must also be actively enrolled and possess a valid username and password for accessing Brown's computer network. If you are unable to create an account in the system and wish to submit, please contact ETD@brown.edu for assistance.</p>

  <p>Electronic dissertations submitted through this process will appear and be archived in the <a href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/studio/collections/dissertation/">Brown Digital Repository (BDR)</a>.</p>

  <p>A searchable <a href="https://login.revproxy.brown.edu/login?url=https://library.brown.edu/theses/">historical database</a> of information about Brown University theses and dissertations from 1893 to 2000 is available.</p>

  <p>After you successfully defend your dissertation you may begin the electronic submission process.</p>
